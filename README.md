# Coding Challenge BWI
The aim of this challenge was to develop an algorithm to fill two trucks with the maximum usability possible. To do this task, a greedy algorithm was chosen because it provides fast solution times.

# Run the code
To run the code, make sure that the Python package "copy" is installed. Once that is ensured, simply navigate to the directory with the code and run the code by typing "python3 greedy_new.py" in your console

# Solution
Solution taken from the code:
